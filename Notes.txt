This is one of the projects that I intend to show off on my portfolio. What it supposed to be is a the HTML structure and the CSS styling needed to make a typical apllication page. Many methods of HTML have been used that are also used in actual application sites. 
The Css is very simple as can be seen. 
Please, note that it is not functional because there is no frontend nor backend Javascript.  This is just the structure and the styling.


Overall, I'm happy with how it turned out.
